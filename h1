he Moscow Police Department in Idaho will hold a news conference Friday afternoon to announce developments in the investigation into the killings of four University of Idaho students.

The police department’s announcement of the news conference at 1 p.m. local time (4 p.m. ET) comes a day after police said they have received about 20,000 tips through more than 9,025 emails, 4,575 phone calls, and 6,050 digital media submissions, while having conducted over 300 interviews in the case of the four students slain in an off-campus home.

No suspect, motive or weapon has been identified.

The students, Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Madison Mogen, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Kernodle’s boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, 20; were likely asleep when they were each stabbed multiple times in the early hours of November 13, authorities have said. Some of the victims had defensive wounds, a coroner has said.
